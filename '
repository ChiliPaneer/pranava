        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <p>
          Uma Eyyunni graduated with a masters degree in Ear, Nose, Throat
          (ENT) surgery from Osmania Medical, Hyderabad. She married Ram
          Eyyunni, a General Surgeon from Hyderabad, and came to the United
          States in 1976. She pursued additional training in ENT at Thomas
          Jefferson University in Philadelphia, PA. She successfully practiced
          as an ENT surgeon for 16 years in in Martinsburg, WV and
          subsequently relocated to St. Augustine, FL.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to her commitment to the medical field, Uma has deep
          passion for literature, poetry and music. Her interests were
          supported by her family that resulted in her publishing her poetry
          in Telugu, her mother tongue. The lyrics of several of these poems
          are set to music and rendered by very well known Indian artists and
          released as audio CDs. Several of these poems have also been set to
          music, rendered by artists in the US and performed on the stage in
          several cities in the US. She also has published poetry and novels
          in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides poetry, Uma has written lyrics for many dance ballets in the
          Indian languages of Telugu, Hindi & Sanskrit. Several of the
          musicals were performed for raising funds for local organizations
          and also to help the victims affected by hurricanes in Florida and
          Puerto Rico. The musicals were performed in several cities within
          the US and in India and received accolades.
        </p>
        <p>
          She is very active in the community and loves to give back to the
          society. She mentored many elementary school children to reduce the
          high school drop out rate, as part of a voluntary program in West
          Virginia. She actively participates in the American Association of
          University Women, a local chapter, is a patron member of American
          Association of Physicians from India, National Alliance on Mental
          Illness and several other local organizations. Along with a team Uma
          started a non-profit organization, Mother's Cry Inc.
          (www.motherscry.net), for community awareness of Mental Health.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uma now moved to the music city of Nashville, TN with her husband
          and son Sreekar Eyyunni to be close to her daughter Swathi Eyyunni,
          who is a Paediatric E.R. Physician and grandchildren. Enjoying the
          semi-retired life, Uma continues to support local organizations in
          Nashville, actively involved with NAMI and continues to pursue her
          passions. The Eyyunni family is a great asset to the local community
          with their sincere voluntary services.
